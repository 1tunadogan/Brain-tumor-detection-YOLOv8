# YOLOv8 Brain Tumor Detection

## Project Description

This project uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) to detect brain tumors. YOLOv8 is a powerful object detection model known for its high accuracy and fast processing speed. This application aims to speed up the diagnosis process in healthcare by automatically detecting tumors in brain MRI images.

## Features

- Detects tumors in brain MRI images
- High accuracy with low false positive rate
- Real-time analysis and predictions
- Support for training and inference

## Performance

The performance of the model is demonstrated through the following visuals:

- **Normalized Confusion Matrix:**
